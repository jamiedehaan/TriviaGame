When the user presses the start button a timer begins counting down from 60 seconds. That is the total time allotted to answer the five multiple choice questions. Users are only able to select one answer for each question. If 60 seconds is up and the user has not pressed the submit button, an alert will pop up saying "Game Over" and the quiz will not be submitted. If the user clicks "Submit" within 60 seconds, they will see how many questions they got correct.
